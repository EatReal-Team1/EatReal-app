# EatReal-app
You can run the app on simulator by openning up "EatReal.xcodeproj". Notice the other project that ends with v1 is just an ealier version. Once the app is started, you can log in by typing in one of the following usernames: "leannesxh14", "zer", and "efeng". The password input field is just a place holder for now.
